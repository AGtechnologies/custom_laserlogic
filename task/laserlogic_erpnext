I attached the template for your reference. Basically, he wants a specific formula to find out how much stocks he should order. 

Formula will be MAX-PO-OH+SO = Reorder quantity

Max - maximum amount of stocks he should have in the warehouse at a time
Min - minimum amount of stocks he should have in the warehouse at a time
PO- Purchase Order, stocks ordered already waiting to be delivered to warehouse
SO-Sales Order, stocks ordered by customers to be sent out
OH -On hand, current stocks in the warehouse at that time


use default COA as per AG Technologies
